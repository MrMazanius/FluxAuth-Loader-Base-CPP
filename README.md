# C++ FluxAuth Base
Easy to use FluxAuth.com Base written in C++
#### This Project Is Intended for Beginners, to get a better understanding of making loaders. And I KNOW this isnt the best way to implement this.





## How to use

#### Because of GitHub's File Restrictions, I can't upload the FluxAuth .lib file and the xor.h file. So you will have to download it yourself. 

*(Which is pretty simple)*

#### You can download the 2 files from the link below

```bash
  https://github.com/MrMazanius/FluxAuth-Loader-Base-CPP/releases/tag/extras
```
#### Now you should have 2 file installed. And they should be named:
```bash
  FluxSDK.lib
```
```bash
  xor.h
```
#### Once you have that installed, drag both files into your project right besides the main .cpp file.

##### It Should Look Like This:
```bash
  "\Cheat Loader Base Fluxauth\Cheat Loader Base Fluxauth\FluxSDK.lib"
  "\Cheat Loader Base Fluxauth\Cheat Loader Base Fluxauth\xor.h"
```

#### Reminder: Make sure to refresh your files in visual studio, and right click the .lib and xor.h files and press *'Include in project'*


## Build settings
#### These are my options for building. And they should already be set by default.

```bash
  Release | x64 - C++ 20 - Multi-byte Character Set
```
