# C++ FluxAuth Base
Easy to use FluxAuth.com Base written in C++
#### This Project Is Intended for Beginners, to get a better understanding of making loaders. And I KNOW this isnt the best way to implement this.





## How to use

#### Because of GitHub's File Limit Restrictions, I can't upload the FluxAuth .lib file. So you will have to download it yourself. 

*(Which is pretty simple)*

#### You can download the C++ FluxAuth Example from the link below.

```bash
  https://fluxauth.com/assets/sdks/cpp.zip
```

#### Once you have that installed, extract it. Now find the .lib file and drag it into your project right besides your main .cpp file.

##### It Should Look Like This:
```bash
  "\Cheat Loader Base Fluxauth\Cheat Loader Base Fluxauth\FluxSDK.lib"
```

#### Reminder: Make sure to refresh your files in visual studio, and right click the .lib file and press *'Include in project'*


## Build settings
#### These are my options for building. And they should already be set by default.

```bash
  Release | x64
  C++ 20
  Multi-byte
```
